retrive api view is almost same as list api view

instead of getting a query set in case of list api view it gets a single object
but works similar on the basis of the listapi view

s0 now if api/posts/ give me all the posts now i want to add id to the /api/post/3
to give me the exact view

the basic procedure is just add a view in the views.py as 

class PostDetailAPIView(RetrieveAPIView):
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer

after this import this into the urls.py in api as from .views import PostDetailAPIView
after this just add the url pattern for the same
  url(r'^(?P<pk>\d+)/$',PostDetailAPIView.as_view(), name='detail'),
  ###(?P<slug>[\w-]+)
   so what if we wanted to change this to other slugs. means instead of adding pk at 	end of the link add any other field 
  for doing this we can do the following        
	url(r'^(?P<slug>[\w-]+)/$',PostDetailAPIView.as_view(), name='detail'),

 it'll give an error postdetailapiview to be called with a keyword pk so we can make the follong change: istead of slug write pk above
  like: url(r'^(?P<pk>[\w-]+)/$',PostDetailAPIView.as_view(), name='detail'),

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/posts/yeah-buddy/
this wont give the details and the reason for this is because by default it is id 
so we need to change the lookup field 
so we can go to views and make this change 
 class PostDetailAPIView(RetrieveAPIView):
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer
    lookup_field = 'slug'

we can add some additional things inside the serilizer if want deatil view to have slightly diff look means we can shoowupp some fields in some and other in other
